# Spring Initializr TUI

[![Release Native Binaries](https://github.com/danvega/spring-initializr-tui/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danvega/spring-initializr-tui/actions/workflows/release.yml)

An interactive terminal UI for scaffolding Spring Boot projects, powered by the [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) API. Built with [TamboUI](https://tamboui.dev), a declarative Java TUI framework.

I had an idea to improve my personal workflow for scaffolding Spring Boot projects, so I made a [video](https://youtu.be/J9C2MiQTIYs) about it. This is the code that goes along with that video.

## Screenshots

### Splash Screen
The app launches with a Spring-styled ASCII art logo and a progress bar while it fetches metadata from the start.spring.io API.
![Splash Screen](screenshots/splash_screen.png)

### Main Screen
The main configuration form lets you set your project type, language, Spring Boot version, group, artifact, description, packaging, Java version, and more. Below the form is a searchable, categorized dependency picker where you can browse and toggle dependencies.

### Explore Build Files
Preview your generated build file before downloading. Switch between `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, and `build.gradle.kts` with syntax-highlighted content and line numbers. Your current project settings are displayed at the top for reference.
![Explore](screenshots/explore.png)

### Generate & Open in IDE
After generation, the project is extracted to your chosen directory. The app auto-detects installed IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.) and lets you open the project directly, open in your terminal, generate another, or quit.

## Supported Platforms

- macOS (aarch64)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)

## Requirements

- **JDK 25** (LTS)
- **Maven 3.9+**
- **GraalVM 25** (optional, for native image)

## Build & Run

### JVM

```bash
mvn compile exec:java
```

### JAR

#### Maven

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
java --enable-preview -jar target/spring-initializr-tui-0.1.1.jar
```

#### Gradle

```bash
gradle jar -x test
java --enable-preview -jar build/libs/spring-initializr-tui-<version>.jar
```

### Fat JAR (Shade)

Build a self-contained JAR with all dependencies bundled:

#### Maven

```bash
mvn package -Pshade -DskipTests
java --enable-preview -jar target/spring-initializr-tui-*.jar
```

#### Gradle

```bash
gradle shadowJar -x test
java --enable-preview -jar build/libs/spring-initializr-tui-<version>-all.jar
```

### Native Image (GraalVM)

Compile to a standalone native binary for instant startup:

#### Maven

```bash
mvn clean -Pnative package -DskipTests
./target/spring-initializr-tui
```

#### Gradle

```bash
gradle compileNative
./build/native/nativeCompile/spring-initializr-tui
```

> Requires GraalVM 25 as your `JAVA_HOME`. If using SDKMAN: `sdk use java 25.0.2-graalce`

## Setting Up Shell Access

For quick access from any directory, set up an alias or add the binary to your PATH.

### macOS / Linux

Add an alias to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias spring='/path/to/spring-initializr-tui'
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows

Add the directory containing `spring-initializr-tui.exe` to your PATH, or create a doskey alias:

```cmd
doskey spring="C:\path\to\spring-initializr-tui.exe" $*
```

To make it permanent, add the binary's directory to your system PATH via **Settings > System > About > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables**, or use PowerShell:

```powershell
$binDir = "C:\path\to"
$path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$path;$binDir", "User")
```

### Usage

Once configured, create a new project from anywhere:

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
spring
```

The generated project will be extracted into the current working directory.

## Themes

The TUI supports color themes. The default is `spring` (the classic Spring green palette). To switch themes, edit `~/.spring-initializr/config.json` and set the `theme` field:

```json
{
  "theme": "catppuccin-mocha"
}
```

### Available Themes

| Theme | Description | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| `spring` | Default Spring green palette | ![Spring](screenshots/themes/spring.png) |
| `catppuccin-mocha` | Catppuccin Mocha — a warm blue-toned dark theme | ![Catppuccin Mocha](screenshots/themes/catppuccin-mocha.png) |
| `dracula` | Dracula — vibrant purple and cyan dark theme | ![Dracula](screenshots/themes/dracula.png) |
| `nord` | Nord — cool, minimal frost-blue palette | ![Nord](screenshots/themes/nord.png) |
| `gruvbox-dark` | Gruvbox Dark — warm, retro orange and yellow palette | ![Gruvbox Dark](screenshots/themes/gruvbox-dark.png) |
| `tokyo-night` | Tokyo Night — modern blue and cyan dark theme | ![Tokyo Night](screenshots/themes/tokyo-night.png) |
| `synthwave-84` | Synthwave '84 — cool, neon cyberpunk dark theme | ![Synthwave '84](screenshots/themes/synthwave-84.png) |

The theme is loaded at startup. To switch, change the value in `config.json` and relaunch the app. If the `theme` field is missing or unrecognized, it defaults to `spring`.

## Open in Terminal

After project generation, the IDE/editor selection list includes an "Open in Terminal" option as its last entry. When selected, the TUI exits and prints the project directory path along with a ready-to-copy `cd` command so you can navigate there immediately. If a [post-generate hook](#post-generate-hook) is configured, it still runs after the TUI exits.

The footer hint updates dynamically to show `[Enter] Open in Terminal` when this option is highlighted.

## Post-Generate Hook

You can configure a command to run automatically in the generated project directory after the TUI exits. This is useful for launching tools like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) right after scaffolding a project.

Edit `~/.spring-initializr/config.json` and add a `postGenerateCommand`:

```json
{
  "postGenerateCommand": "claude",
  ...
}
```

When set, the generate screen will show the hook in the footer (e.g., `[Enter] Open + run claude`). After you select an IDE and press Enter, the TUI exits, the IDE opens, and then the configured command runs in the project directory with full terminal control.

Set `postGenerateCommand` to an empty string `""` (or remove it) to disable the hook.

## About TamboUI

This project is built with [TamboUI](https://tamboui.dev), a declarative TUI framework for Java. TamboUI provides an immediate-mode rendering model where the UI is always a function of state, similar to how modern web frameworks work but for the terminal.

Key concepts used in this project:

- **Toolkit DSL** -- static methods like `text()`, `row()`, `column()`, `panel()`, `tabs()`, `gauge()`, and `spinner()` compose into a tree of elements
- **Immediate-mode rendering** -- the `render()` method is called on every frame and returns the full UI based on current state
- **Event handling** -- keyboard events are handled via `onKeyEvent()` callbacks
- **Widgets** -- built-in components like `TabsState`, `TextInputState`, and `FormState` manage interactive state
